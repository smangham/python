Description
###########

This directory contains python scripts for use with the C code python.
You will need to run `write_docs.py` from that directory to generate this documentation.

The basic python modules required can be found in `requirements.txt`.

Using `hydro_2_python` requires the `pyhdf` module, which itelf requires the `libhdf4-dev` package.
This can be installed manually or via your package manager or from the site [here](https://support.hdfgroup.org/downloads/index.html).
