Synopsis:  

When running a grid of models, it may not be clear whether
all of the runs have been completed, especially if time limits
are placed on the individual runs.  This routine checks the
.sig files to see which of a list of .pf files have been 
completed.


Command line usage (if any):

    usage: grid_check.py filename 

    where filename contains a list of the .pf files that need to be checked

Description:  

    The routine reads a file containing a list of .pf files, excluding those
    with out.pf extensions and then checks the .sig files to see whether
    the run is complete.  
    
    It generates a table Status.txt that contians the completion 
    status of each .pf file and writes to the screen some information about
    those that do not appear to be complete.

    Additionally, if there are runs that look to be incomplete it writes out
    a file XRunRest that contains a proto run file for the incompleted runs.  
    This will need to be edited for each specific situation.
