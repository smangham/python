  Synopsis:  

  This is a routine which is intended to help with program updates that
  change the name of a keyword in a parameter file.  It is called from
  rdpar.string_process_from_file

  Description:	

  The routine simply matches the string in new_question to a string in
  the array new_names, below.  If it finds a match, the old_name is 
  returned in old_question.



  Arguments:  	


  Returns:

  	0 if there was no match
	1 if there was a match of a name in the parameter file to
	  one of the new_names, and in old_question the name of
	  the old_value

  Notes:

  To add another variable to the list, just record the new_name and the
  old_name in the arrays below, and increase the number of names by 1

  Do not include the material that is in paren, that is for

  xxx(many_choices) -->  xxxx

  The routine is completely hardwired as wrtten though clearly this 
  could be changed.
  	


  History:
	16sept	ksl	Coded as part of an effort to make python more 
			robust to changes in parameter file names
