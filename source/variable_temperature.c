 * @brief
 * This file was created to contain all of the routines associated
 * with calculating ionization using the so-called pair-wise
 * dilute bb and pairwise power law models.  Collectively these are
 * sometimes referred to as variable temperature models.  Both
 * involve
 * attempt to calculate ionic abundances using a
 * temperature fixed for each pair of ions to make the uncorrected
 * abundance ratio roughly equal to 1. There are then correction
 * factors applied, either based upon a piece_wise power law model of
 * the true radiation field, or as a dilute blackbody.
