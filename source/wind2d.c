 Synopsis:
	define_wind  initializes the structure which characterize the wind.  

Arguments:		
	WindPtr w;			The structure which defines the wind in Python
 
Returns:
 
Description:

	This the basic routine which initiallizes the wind structure, calculating the
	salient properties of the wind in each grid cell. 
		
Notes:  This routine has been modified a lot as multiple coordinate systems were implemented
        Now it is mostly a driver for routines found elsewhere.
	

History:
 	97jan      ksl	Coding on python began.
 	97sep13	ksl	Added the possibility of fixing the concentrations of the ions to specific
			values
 	97nov19 ksl	Fixed dmdot_da to account for the fact that mass is lost from both sides
                        of the disk.
 	98mar20	ksl	Fixed calculation of wind_midx and wind_midz.  New code is actually
 			in wind_complete
 	98may24	ksl	Modified calculations of wind volumes to force the edges to have zero volume
 			because the edge points are actually only used for interpolation and photons
 			do not interact in them.
 	98dec	ksl	Eliminated wind element .rzero, Added capability to define linear or logarithmic
 			intervals on the fly  Isolated all dependences on Shlossman and Vitello 
 			prescription of the wind to subroutine calls, which are in the file sv.c
 	98dec22	ksl	Added routines to allow definition of a one d stellar wind.  Weights inside
 			star artificially set to 0.5
	99dec29 ksl	Added routines for proga's wind 
	00oct06	ksl	Added routines for a corona
	01mar13	ksl	Added routines for knigge's wind
	01dec26	ksl	Deleted wind_summary routine since I haven't looked at this output for several 
			years (largely replaced by py_wind)
	02feb	ksl	Made changes to allow unequal dimensions in two directions
        04May   SS      Factor of two increase in the cell volumes to allow for space above and below plane.
	04aug	ksl	Began removing portions of this routine which were coordinate sytem independent
			to individial routines in wind.c.  Also redefined what is meant by .inwind.
        04Aug   SS      Modified the calulation of whether a cell is in the wind because it was 
                        missing cells when a finite disk is included (the cell corners could lie in the disk
                        but there could still be genuine wind material within the cell).
	05jul	ksl	56d -- Added checks of volume calculations for two d models as part of general
			effort to properly incoporate a vertically extneded disk.
	06may	ksl	Modified order in which items were calculated to prepare for splitting
			of the Wind structure.  Moved the creation of thw arrays here as well
			Allowed for wheich variables need to go into plasma
	06nov	ksl	58b -- Modified to identify cells which have a a calculated wind volume
			of zero, but one or more corners in the wind.  The assumption is that
			photons were intended to simply fly through these cells.  Also modified to
			use #define variables, such as W_ALL_INWIND, for describing the type of gridcell.
	07jul	kls	58f -- Added code to copy volumes from wmain[].vol to plasmamain[].vol
        12aug   nsh	73d -- Added some code to zero some parameters in the plasma structure used to 
			try and speed up the pairwise ionization scheme
	13may	nsh	added code to use temprature computed from internal energy in a
			zeus file as a first guess for temperature in a proga type model
	13sep	nsh	small change to avoid the muliplicatoin by 0.9 (lucy guess) from giving us the
			wrong zeus temperature.
	13nov	nsh	changes to take account of log formulation of power law
			also initialise the min and max frequencies seen in a band.
	14jul	nsh	added call to calloc_dyn_plasma to allocate space for arrays of variable size - currently
			those with length nion.
	15jul	nsh 	added a mode for fixed temperature, which does not multiply wind temp by 0.9 
			so you get what you ask for
	15aug	jm	Adapted for multiple domains

 Synopsis:
	vwind_xyz(ndom,p,v) finds the velocity vector v for the wind in cartesian 
	coordinates at the position of the photon p.
 
 Arguments:		
	int ndom;  
	PhotPtr p;
	double v[];

Returns:
	0 	on successful completion
		the value of where in grid if the photon outside the wind grid.
 
Description:
	This routine carries out a bilinear interpolation of the wind velocity.  The velocities
	at the edges of the grid cells must have been defined elsewhere (e.g in wind_define).
	
	If the position is outside the wind grid, then the velocities will be returned as 0.	
	
Notes:
	For all of the 2d coordinate systems, the positions in the WindPtr array are
	caclulated in the xz plane.  As a result, the velocities in that array are
	calcuated there as well.  Hence, to obtain the velocity in cartesion coordinates
	one needs to do a simple rotation of the velocity vector.  

	For spherical (1d) coordinates the situation is complex, the philosopy that
	has been adopted is to let the program run even if the wind model is intrinsically
	2d.   The xyz positions of the grid are defined are defined so that
	are in the xz plane at an angle of 45 degrees to the x axis.  This was done
	so that if one used, say an sv wind, in spherical coordinates, one would select
	the wind velocities at a plausible location.   But it implies that the velocities
	that have been accepted are not purely radial as one might expect.  The choice
	that has been made is to assume that v[1] is preserved as a non zero value in
	making the projection.  An alternative might have been to preserve the angular
	rotation rate.
	
	Regardless, the fundamental challenge is to make sure the program works correctly 
	for the spherically symmetric case, e.g a simple stellar wind, which it did not
	before 56b.  

	If we ever implement a real 3d coordinate system, one will need to look at
	this routine again.

 Synopsis:
  wind_div_v calculates the divergence of the velocity at the center of all the grid cells.  
Arguments:    

Returns:
 
Description:  
  This is one of the initialization routines for the wind.   
  Because the routine calls vwind_xyz, one must have previously 
  populated w[].v.  Also as a result of this fact, the routine 
  is not tightly tied to the SV prescription.
Notes:
  It is used to calculated PdV cooling of a grid cell 

  The divergence, like othe scalar quantities, does not
  need to be "rotated" differently in different coordinate
  systems

History:
  98mar20 ksl First coded and debugged 
  99dec1  ksl Explicitly typed as integer and made the return 0
      Previously it was untyped, but returned div/EPSILON
      which made no sense to me.
  04mar ksl This routine traditionally has generated
      lots of errors.  One reason for could have beeen
      that the step size was too large.  So I made this
      smaller.  But the other reason is that the div v
      is often calculated outside the wind cone, as in
      kwd winds.  In those cases, I put an extrapolation
      of the wind velocity inside the wind cone, but
      this is not necessarily physical.  If the div v
      is interpolated this could be wrong.  I have 
      made some minor modifications though to suppress
      multiple errors if the div is being calculated
      outside the wind.
  05apr ksl 55d -- Switched to using center positions for
      this calculation, rather than wind_midx, and 
      wind_midz.  Basically this was because I wanted
      to make things as independent of these two 
      arrays as possible in preparation for allowing
      more arbitrarily spaced grids.  Furthermore
      the previously formulatin was incorrect for
      rtheta components since wind_midz was actually
      theta.  It was also helpful for spherical models, 
      since it avoids the necessity of going from 1d to
      2d specification.
  13mar nsh 74b6 -- Several of the calls were addressing the
      wind as if it was a single cell, however the call
      to wind_div_v supplies the whole wind structure.
      calls that looked like w-> have been replaced by
      w[icell].
  14feb JM -- Fix for Issue #70. Instead of taking the midpoint
      and stepping ds in the +ve direction, we now step
      0.5ds in both +ve and -ve. This stops negative values of
      dvdy appearing in rotationally dominated portions of wind,
      and in some cases even leading to div_v being negative.

Synopsis:
  check_grid() loops over the entire wind points and checks quantities
  like velocity gradients and optical depths across cells for large changes.
  If there are large changes in cells, it tells the user how many cells and
  suggests that the grid may need to be modified.

Arguments: None   

Returns: 0 for success
 
Description:  

Notes:
  Must be called after define wind so NPLASMA and densities are set up.
