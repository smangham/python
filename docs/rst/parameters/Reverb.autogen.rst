.. py:function:: reverb.type

   Whether to perform reverberation mapping. Reverberation mapping tracks the
   path of photons emitted in the simulation as they travel through the geometry,
   assuming that any delays from recombination etc. are negligible and all delays
   are due to light travel time. For each final spectrum, all contributing
   photons are output to a '.delay_dump' file that can then be processed using
   our 'tfpy' Python (no relation) library.

   :param none: Off
   :param photon: Each photon is assigned an initial path based on its distance from the
     central source (assuming emission in the disk and wind is correlated with
     emission from the CO).
   :param wind: CO photons are assigned paths as in Photon mode, disk photons are assigned
     paths as set by the reverb.disk_type parameter. Photons generated in the
     wind are assigned a path based on the *distribution* of paths of photons
     that have contributed to continuum absorption in that cell.
   :param matom: This works as wind mode, but for a number of specified macro-atom lines
     paths are tracked for those photons who cause a de-excitation into a given
     line. When a photon is emitted in one of those lines, the path is drawn from
     that specific distribution. This distribution is build up not just from the
     last cycle of the simulation, but from all cycles after the wind achieves
     >90% convergence. This is necessary as some lines are poorly-sampled.

     This mode gives pretty much identical results to wind mode, but at least we
     made it to check rather than just assuming it would be fine.

     This requires that :ref:`Line_transfer` is either ``macro_atoms`` or
     ``macro_atoms_thermal_trapping``

Reverb.type
===========
Whether to perform reverberation mapping. Reverberation mapping tracks the
path of photons emitted in the simulation as they travel through the geometry,
assuming that any delays from recombination etc. are negligible and all delays
are due to light travel time. For each final spectrum, all contributing
photons are output to a '.delay_dump' file that can then be processed using
our 'tfpy' Python (no relation) library.

**Type:** Enumerator

**Values:**

none
  **Off**

photon
  Each photon is assigned an initial path based on its distance from the
  central source (assuming emission in the disk and wind is correlated with
  emission from the CO).

wind
  CO photons are assigned paths as in Photon mode, disk photons are assigned
  paths as set by the reverb.disk_type parameter. Photons generated in the
  wind are assigned a path based on the *distribution* of paths of photons
  that have contributed to continuum absorption in that cell.

matom
  This works as wind mode, but for a number of specified macro-atom lines
  paths are tracked for those photons who cause a deexcitation into a given
  line. When a photon is emitted in one of those lines, the path is drawn from
  that specific distribution. This distribution is build up not just from the
  last cycle of the simulation, but from all cycles after the wind achieves
  >90% convergence. This is necessary as some lines are poorly-sampled.

  This mode gives pretty much identical results to wind mode, but at least we
  made it to check rather than just assuming it would be fine.

  This requires that :ref:`Line_transfer` is either ``macro_atoms`` or
  ``macro_atoms_thermal_trapping``


**File:** setup_reverb.c


Reverb.matom_lines
------------------
Number of macro-atom lines to track paths for individually. This many
reverb.matom_line entries are required, and the line associated with each has
the path of photons deexciting into it recorded in its own array. Note: This
doesn't give rise to any noticable differences to the pure wind mode in most
simulations.

**Type:** Integer

**Values:** Greater than or equal to 0

**Parent(s):**

* :ref:`Reverb.type`: matom

* :ref:`Line_transfer`: ``macro_atoms``, ``macro_atoms_thermal_trapping``


**File:** setup_reverb.c


Reverb.matom_line
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Specifies a line associated with a given macro-atom transition. The species
and transition involved are specified. The internal line associated with this
transition will be printed to standard-out for use when processing outputs. A
line is specified as Element:Ion:Upper level:Lower level.

**Type:** Int:Int:Int:Int


**Values:** >0:>0:>1:>0


**Parent(s):**

* :ref:`Reverb.matom_lines`: Greater than 0, once per matom line.


**File:** setup_reverb.c


Reverb.filter_lines
-------------------
Whether or not to filter any lines out of the output file. This is used to keep output
file sizes down, and avoid them overwhelming the user.

**Type:** Int

**Values:**

0
  **No filtering**

  Include *all* photons that contribute to the spectra in the output
  file. Not recommended as it leads to gargantuan file sizes.

-1
  **Filter continuum**

  Include all photons whose last interaction was scatter
  or emission in a line. Recommended setting for exploratory runs where you'd
  like to identify which lines are the easiest to process.

N
  **Filter lines**

  Include N :ref:`reverb.filter_line` entries, each specifying one
  line to keep in the output file. If :ref:`reverb.matom_lines` is >0, all macro-atom
  lines of interest are automatically included in the filter list.


**Parent(s):**

* :ref:`Reverb.type`: ``wind``, ``matom``


**File:** setup_reverb.c


Reverb.filter_line
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Line number of one line to include in the output ``.delay_dump`` file. This is
the python internal line number. It can be found using either the macro-atom
mode (which prints out the line number once it's found one) or by doing an
exploratory run with :ref:`reverb.filter_lines` = -1, then looking through the delay
dump file for photons of the right wavelength to see what their line is. This
should almost certainly be changed to be specified using a species and
wavelength!

**Type:** Integer

**Values:** Any valid line index

**Parent(s):**

* :ref:`Reverb.filter_lines`: Greater than 0, once per filer line.


**File:** setup_reverb.c


Reverb.path_bins
----------------
Number of bins for photon paths. Reverb modes that record the distribution of
path lengths in every wind cell bin them in this number of bins. Bins are
logarithmically spaced between the minimum scale in the system (the smallest
'minimum radius' in any domain) and the 10 * the maximum scale in the system
(10 * the 'maximum radius' in any domain). Default value is 1000, going much
higher does not lead to qualitative differences in TF, going lower makes the
bin boundaries show up in the TF.

**Type:** Integer

**Values:** Greater than 0

* :ref:`Reverb.type`: ``wind``, ``matom``


**File:** setup_reverb.c


Reverb.visualisation
--------------------
Which type of visualisation to output, if any. Reverb modes that keep arrays
of photon paths per cell can output them either as averages in a 3d model, or
as a selection of flat text files with full bin-by-bin breakdowns. Useful for
diagnostics.

**Type:** Enumerator

**Values:**

none
  No visualisation.

vtk
  Mesh visualisation. Outputs mean incident path per cell, photon count per cell, and mean
  observed delay to '.vtk' format, readable using a range of programs including
  (my preferred option) VisIt, available at https://visit.llnl.gov/.

dump
  Outputs distributions of paths for continuum heating and each line to a range of 'dump cells'
  specified by X & Z position.

both
  Outputs both vtk and dump.

Reverb.dump_cells
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Number of cells to dump. When dumping the path distribution info for a range
of cells, this specifies the number of lines of :ref:`Reverb.dump_cell` that will be
provided.

**Type:** Integer

**Values:** Greater than or equal to 0

**Parent(s):**

* :ref:`Reverb.visualisation`: ``wind``, ``matom``


**File:** setup_reverb.c


**Reverb.dump_cell**
""""""""""""""""""""
Position for a cell, listed as a pair of R:Z coordinates. Will accept any
position that falls within a grid, will error out on ones that don't. This can
be slightly awkward and you may want to run a quick test then use py_wind to
idenfity where wind locations are.

**Type:** Float:Float


**Unit:** cm:cm


**Values:** >0:>0


**Parent(s):**

* :ref:`Reverb.dump_cells`: Greater than 0


**File:** setup_reverb.c


Reverb.angle_bins
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Used when generating 3d .vtk output files for visualisation. Sets the number
of angle bins used in the output. Aesthetic only; bigger makes prettier meshes
with larger filesizes.

**Type:** Integer

**Values:** Greater than 0

**Parent(s):**

* :ref:`Reverb.visualisation`: ``vtk``, ``both``


**File:** setup_reverb.c


Reverb.disk_type
----------------
Setting for how photons generated in the disk are treated when generating path
distributions for wind cells.

**Type:** Enumerator

**Values:**

correlated
  This mode assumes that disk emission is correlated with the
  central source. Photons generated in the disk start with a delay equal to
  the direct distance to the central source. This assumes that the ionisation
  state and luminosity of the disk surface layer is mostly determined by
  unscattered photons from the central source.

uncorrelated
  This mode generates photons with a delay of 0 wherever in the
  disk they come from. This mode is of slightly questionable use and should be
  ignored in preference to 0 or 2. It will, in practise, generally work out
  similar to type 0 as most of the UV photons are generated close-in to the CO.

ignore
  This mode assumes that disk photons do *not* correlate
  with the central source (i.e. disk surface  ionisation state and emissivity is
  driven not by irradiation from the CO but by the mass inflow). This means that
  whilst they contribute to heating the wind, they do not strongly contribute to
  the lags for a given line. Photons generated by the disk do not contribute to
  the path distributions in the wind in this mode.

  By removing the (generally) short-delay disk photons from the wind path
  distributions, this will slightly bias them towards the longer delays
  associated with wind self-heating/excitation.
