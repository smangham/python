How to use the auto-documentation tools
---------------------------------------

*python* has two documentation tools, stored in the *py_progs* directory, and a common file
format for documenting the python functions.

YAML documentation
------------------

The documentation for *python* variables takes the form of *YAML* input files stored in
*docs/parameters*. These are functionally more or less just *Python* dictionaries, and have a very
flexible structure. A full example outline is:

.. literalinclude:: reference_yaml.txt
   :language: yaml
   :lines: 1-12


The **required** keys that must be present in any file are ``name``, ``description``, ``type``
and ``file``.

For enumerators, a more complex setup can be used for the ``values`` key outlining all the
possible choices:

.. literalinclude:: reference_yaml.txt
   :language: yaml
   :lines: 14-25

TODO: Make structure of parent explicit.

autogenerate_parameter_docs.py
------------------------------

This tool takes the *python* .c input files, and scans them for calls to input parameters from file.
It is run from the command line as::

  python autogenerate_parameter_docs.py

This mode will tell you which parameters are **new**, and undocumented, and which files are
**deprecated** and refer to parameters that no longer exist. In many cases, deprecated parameters
will simply be renamed. You can use this as a reminder to rename the parameter and tweak the *YAML*
documentation file.

Once this has been done, it can be run using::

  python autogenerate_parameter_docs.py -w

This will move any deprecated documentation to *docs/parameters/old*, and generate new *YAML*
documentation files for the new parameters in *docs/parameters*. You can now proceed to fill
in the documentation skeletons produced by the utility.


----------------------------------------

autogenerate_rtd_pages.py
-------------------------

This tool takes the `YAML documentation`_ input files, and converts them into *RST* files and from there a *HTML*
documentation page using *Sphinx*. You don't need to know anything about the formats in order to use
it- you simply need *Sphinx* installed, and it is available as a MacPorts package or through apt
on 'nix systems.

It will read the files in the *docs/parameters* directory and build a *HTML* page,
then automatically open it in your browser. You may see some errors during the creation::

   while scanning a block scalar
    in "/Users/amsys/python/docs/parameters/sv.diskmin.yaml", line 5, column 7
   expected chomping or indentation indicators, but found 'c'
    in "/Users/amsys/python/docs/parameters/sv.diskmin.yaml", line 5, column 8

This occurs during the *YAML* step when a file has an invalid entry, and that parameter file will be
skipped as a consequence. Typically it is cause when a text line is malformed. For inline text
(e.g. ``values: condition``) it occurs when the string starts with a non-alphanumeric character like
``>` (so ```values: >0`` is invalid).

You may also see it when using block text (e.g. ``description:|``) if the following lines are not
correctly indented e.g.::

   description:|
   The text for values has not been indented correctly
   and so will throw an error.

   description:|
     This text has been indented
     and so will not throw an error

A common warning is::

   WARNING: Unknown target name:

This occurs during the *Sphinx* step when it cannot link to the parent for a variable. If a
parameter has a parent provided as a ``key:value`` pair e.g. ``reverb.type: Anything above 3``.

*Sphinx* will automatically try to link to ``reverb.type`` as its parent. If the name is misspelled
(e.g. ``rverb.type``) or the parameter simply doesn't exist any more, it will throw a warning and
generate a dead link.
