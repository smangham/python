name: Spectrum.select_z
description: |
  Advanced command which defines a spherical  region of
  space from which photons are to be extracted in constructing a detailed
  spectrum.  The region is defined by a cylindrical distance, and z height
  and an aximuth, and a radius r.  This parameter defines the z coordiante
  of the region.
