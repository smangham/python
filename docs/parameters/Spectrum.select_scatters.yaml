name: Spectrum.select_scatters
description: |
  Advaned command that allows one to extract photons that
  have undergone a certain number of scatters.  If n > MAXSCAT,
  that is to say a very large number then all scatters are slected.
  If lies between 0 and MAXSCAT then photons will be extracted only
  at the point a photon has undergone this number of scatters.  If
  n is < 0 then photons with n or greater scattters will be extracted.
