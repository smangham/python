name: SV.acceleration_exponent
description: |
  Power-law acceleration exponent (i.e. alpha) of a line driven wind in a Shlosman & Vitello (SV) CV disk wind model.
  Sets the length scale over which the accleration to v_inf is accomplished.
  This value is a constant; when equal to 1 the results resemble those of a linear velocity law.
  Typically for an SV type wind this power law exponent is 1.5.
  See equation (2) Shlosman & Vitello 1993, ApJ 409, 372.
