name: Corona.vel_frac
description: |
  For the coronal model, the azimuthal velocity is
  given by the velocity of the underlying disk.  One
  can also give the corona a radial velocity, which is
  a fraction of the disk velocity.  (As coded, if this
  number is positive, the velicty is the r direction is
  toward the central object).
type: Double
unit: Disk velocity
values: Any, 0 implies no radial velocity.
