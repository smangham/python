name: Photon_sampling.band_boundary
description: |
  When the user specifies what bands are used for stratfied sampling, this parameter specifies the boundaries
  between energy bands in which a minimum fraction of photons will be generated.  The number of times this
  parameter is request depends upon the number of energies bands being used.
type: Double
unit: eV
values: Greater than 0, monotonically increasing
parent:
  Photon_sampling.nbands: Greater than 0, once per band
