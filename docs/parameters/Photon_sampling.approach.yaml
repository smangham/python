name: Photon_sampling.approach
description: |
  Choice of whether and how to use stratified sampling in creating photons during the
  ionization stage of the calculation.
type: Enumerator
values:
  T_star: Sets a single band based on the temperature given
  cv: Traditional cv setup
  yso: YSO setup
  AGN: Test for balance matching the bands we have been using for AGN runs
  min_max_freq: Mode 1 sets a single wide band defined by f1 and f2
  user_bands: User-defined bands
  cloudy_test: |
    Set up to compare with cloudy power law table command note
    that this also sets up the weight and photon index for the PL, to ensure a continuous distribution
  wide: Test for balance to have a really wide frequency range
  logarithmic: Generalized method to set up logarithmic bands
