name: Reverb.filter_line
description: |
  Line number of one line to include in the output ``.delay_dump`` file. This is
  the python internal line number. It can be found using either the macro-atom
  mode (which prints out the line number once it's found one) or by doing an
  exploratory run with :ref:`reverb.filter_lines` = -1, then looking through the delay
  dump file for photons of the right wavelength to see what their line is. This
  should almost certainly be changed to be specified using a species and
  wavelength!
type: Integer
values: Any valid line index
parent:
  Reverb.filter_lines: Greater than 0, once per filer line.
