name: Homologous.boundary_mdot
description: |
  The mass loss rate at the base of the wind in a homlogous flow model, a flow
  in which the velocity is proporional to the radius.  In general, mdot will
  decline with radius, depending on the exponent of the power law that describes
  the trend in density.
