description: |
  When photons hit the disk, there are several options
type: Enumerator
values:
  reflect: The photons are scattered back into the wind
  absorb: The photons are simply lost from the calculation
  thermalized.rerad: The photons are absorbed, in the next ionization cycle energy lost is treated as extra heat, and the effective temperature of the ring in the disk will be increased accordingly
