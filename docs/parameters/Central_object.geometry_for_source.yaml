name: Central_object.geometry_for_source
description: |
  If the central source in an AGN/BH system is radiating, what geometry should it radiate from?
   This is applicable even for black-body sources, where the *luminosity* depends on :ref:`Central_object.radius`.
type: Enumerator
values:
  lamp_post: |
    The central source radiates from two point sources
    located on the system axis above and below the disk plane.
    Emission is completely isotropic.
  sphere: |
    The central source radiates from a spherical surface with radius :ref:`Central_object.radius`.
    Emission is cosine-weighted in the direction of the sphere normal at the point of emission.
    Photons that would be spawned in an extended disk (if :ref:`Disk.type` is `vertically.extended`)
    are re-generated.
