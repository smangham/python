name: Wind.number_of_components
description: |
  While most simple description of a wind consist of a single region of space, Python can calculate
  radiative transfer through more complicated structres, where one region of space is described with one
  prescription and another region of space with a second prescription. For example, one might want to place
  a disk atmoosphere between the disk and a wind.  This parameter describes the number of components (aka domains)
  of the wind.
