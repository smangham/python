name: Reverb.disk_type
description: |
  Setting for how photons generated in the disk are treated when generating path
  distributions for wind cells.
type: Enumerator
values:
  correlated: |
    This mode assumes that disk emission is correlated with the
    central source. Photons generated in the disk start with a delay equal to
    the direct distance to the central source. This assumes that the ionisation
    state and luminosity of the disk surface layer is mostly determined by
    unscattered photons from the central source.

  uncorrelated: |
    This mode generates photons with a delay of 0 wherever in the
    disk they come from. This mode is of slightly questionable use and should be
    ignored in preference to 0 or 2. It will, in practise, generally work out
    similar to type 0 as most of the UV photons are generated close-in to the CO.

  ignore: |
    This mode assumes that disk photons do *not* correlate
    with the central source (i.e. disk surface  ionisation state and emissivity is
    driven not by irradiation from the CO but by the mass inflow). This means that
    whilst they contribute to heating the wind, they do not strongly contribute to
    the lags for a given line. Photons generated by the disk do not contribute to
    the path distributions in the wind in this mode.

    By removing the (generally) short-delay disk photons from the wind path
    distributions, this will slightly bias them towards the longer delays
    associated with wind self-heating/excitation.
