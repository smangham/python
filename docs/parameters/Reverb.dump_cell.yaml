name: Reverb.dump_cell
description: |
  Position for a cell, listed as a pair of R:Z coordinates. Will accept any
  position that falls within a grid, will error out on ones that don't. This can
  be slightly awkward and you may want to run a quick test then use py_wind to
  idenfity where wind locations are.
