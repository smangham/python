name: Spectrum.type
description: |
  The type of spectra that are produced in the final spectra. The current choices are flambda, fnu, or basic,
  where basic implies simply summing up the energy packets that escape within a particularly wavelength/
  frequency bin.
type: Enumerator
values:
  flambda: λF(λ)
  fnu: νF(ν)
  basic: F(λ)
