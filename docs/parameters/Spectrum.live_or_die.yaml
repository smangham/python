name: Spectrum.live_or_die
description: |
  Normally in creating detailed spectrum Python "extracts" photons in a certain
  direction reweighting them to account for the fact that they have been extracted
  in a certain direction.  It is possible to just count the photons that are emitted
  in a single angle range. The two methods should yield the same or very similar results
  but the extraction method is much more efficient and live or die is basically a
  diagnostic mode.
type: Enumerator
values:
  live.or.die: Count only those photons that escape within a small angle range towards the observer
  extract: Extract a component of all photons that scatter towards the observer
parent:
  Spectrum_cycles: Greater than or equal to 0
